# Exercises
# Learning Python at the Uni-Kiel and GEOMAR python-workshops

# These workshops are for beginners using python - 
# in this case python3.

# I'm student of geophysics and before using Matlab/Octave (and now python) 
# I programmedusing C++ and Fortran.

# (I am trying now to 'translate my old C++ sources 
# and my Matlab/Octave texts in python.)

# As a 'newbie' in python I first attend workshops at our University (JAN 2017) 
# and will show the solutions of the Execises here.
