# Exercises
# Learning Python at the Uni-Kiel and GEOMAR python-workshops. As a 'newbie' in python I first attend workshops at our University (JAN 2017) and will show the solutions of the Execises here.These workshops are for beginners using python - in this case python3.

# I'm student of geophysics and before using Matlab/Octave (and now python) I programmed used HOLs C++ and Fortran.
# (I am trying now to 'translate my old C++ sources and my Matlab/Octave texts in python.)
